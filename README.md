# **FaceRecog-AI**  
### AI-Powered Face Recognition System  

## üìå **Overview**  
FaceRecog-AI is a facial recognition system that allows users to capture, train, and recognize faces in real-time using a webcam. The system is built with OpenCV and DeepFace, providing facial recognition along with age, gender, and emotion detection.  

## üõ† **Steps Involved in the Project**  

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Setting Up the Environment**  
- Install Python and required libraries: OpenCV, NumPy, and DeepFace.  
- Ensure that the webcam is properly connected and accessible.  

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Creating a Face Dataset**  
- Start the program and select the dataset creation option.  
- Enter the name of the person whose face will be captured.  
- The webcam will capture multiple images of the person‚Äôs face.  
- The detected face is cropped, saved, and stored in the dataset folder.  

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Training the Model**  
- Extract facial embeddings using the DeepFace library.  
- Convert the captured images into embeddings for recognition.  
- Save the embeddings for future comparisons.  

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Recognizing Faces in Real-Time**  
- Start the face recognition mode using the webcam.  
- Detect a face in the video stream and extract facial features.  
- Compare the extracted face with stored embeddings.  
- Identify the person or mark them as "Unknown" if no match is found.  
- Display additional information such as age, gender, and emotion.  

### **5Ô∏è‚É£ Enhancements and Future Improvements**  
- Improve accuracy by using advanced face alignment techniques.  
- Expand the dataset to recognize more individuals.  
- Optimize the face matching process for real-time applications.  
- Implement cloud-based storage for datasets and embeddings.  

## üèÜ **Conclusion**  
FaceRecog-AI provides a simple yet effective way to implement real-time facial recognition with additional demographic analysis. With further enhancements, this project can be expanded for security applications, attendance systems, and smart surveillance.
